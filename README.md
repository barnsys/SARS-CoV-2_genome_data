# SARS-CoV-2_genome_data
252 complete genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the first wave (December 2019 - July 2020) of the global COVID-19 pandemic from 21 countries of the world

BEAST_Exp_RC_dated_tree.tree - dated phylogenetic tree, reconstructed using the BEAST 2.6.2 software. The tree was dated by the time of isolation of the virus strains. Coaliscent model - exponential population growth, relaxed molecular clock.

SARS-CoV-2_genome_coding_part.fas - SARS-CoV-2 dataset containing the coding portion of 252 complete viral genomes from 21 countries. The names of the sequences indicate the country of origin of the strain, the time of isolation of the strain, the number from the GISAID database (https://gisaid.org) or Genbank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

SARS-CoV-2_genome_coding_part_1+2_codon_positions.fas - SARS-CoV-2 dataset containing 1 + 2 codon positions for the coding portion of 252 complete virus genomes from 21 countries.

SARS-CoV-2_genome_coding_part_3_codon_positions.fas - SARS-CoV-2 dataset containing the third codon position for the coding portion of 252 complete viral genomes from 21 countries.
